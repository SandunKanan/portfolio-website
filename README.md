# Sandun's Portfolio Website
Built using Vite.js

I use this website to showcase my skills as a Data Scientist and Software Engineer.

My website is currently deployed here:
https://sandun-kanangama.vercel.app/

To run the app from terminal:
git clone git@github.com:SandunKanan/portfolio-website.git__
cd portfolio-website__
npm i__
npm run dev

After running, website will likely be hosted on:
